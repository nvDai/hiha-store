## HiHa Store
Link to the app: https://hiha-clothing-store.herokuapp.com/
### Descriptions
This app is my next React app in my React Journey. The reasons I want to build this app are:
- Relearning React stacks: React, React-router, Redux, Redux-saga, React Hooks
- Learning how to optimize a web app by using: [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect), react lazy + Suspense, lazyload image (use [Imagekit](https://imagekit.io/) tool to automate image optimization)
- Learning how to config a React app with Eslint + Prettier
- Learning Firebase to make User Authentication and store data in Firestore<br>
### Things I wish to do to improve app performance:
- Writing Unit test with Jest
- Optimizing JS chunk more
- Building my own server to improve app performance by using HTTPS, server caching <br>
