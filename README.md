# HiHa Store

Link to the app: <https://hiha-store.herokuapp.com/>

## Descriptions

This app is my next React app in my React Journey. The reasons I want to build this app are:

- Practicing React stacks: React, React-router, Redux, Redux-saga, React Hooks
- Practicing optimizing techniques for a web app by using: [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect), react lazy + Suspense, lazyload image (use [Imagekit](https://imagekit.io/) tool to automate image optimization)
- Using Firebase to make User Authentication and store data in Firestore<br>

### Things I wish to do to improve app performance

- Writing Unit test with Jest (implement 50% unit tests)
- Optimizing JS chunk more
- Building my own server to improve app performance by using HTTPS, server caching <br>
